        Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor and design program developed
        and marketed by Adobe Inc. Originally designed for the Apple Macintosh, development
        of Adobe Illustrator began in 1985. Along with Creative Cloud (Adobe's shift to monthly
        or annual subscription service delivered over the Internet), Illustrator CC was released. The
        latest version, Illustrator CC 2021, was released on October 20, 2020 and is the 25th generation
        in the product line. Adobe Illustrator was reviewed as the best vector graphics editing program in 2018 by PC Magazine.
