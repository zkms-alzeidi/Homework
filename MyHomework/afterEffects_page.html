      <h1><b><em>After Effects</em></b></h1>
      <p>Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application developed
        by Adobe Systems and used in the post-production process of film making, video games and television production.
         Among other things, After Effects can be used for keying, tracking, compositing, and animation. It also functions
         as a very basic non-linear editor, audio editor,
         and media transcoder. In 2019, the program won an Academy Award for scientific and technical achievement.</p>
